            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>Mary Teresa Bojaxhiu, MC (pronounced [bɔjaˈdʒiu]; 26 August 1910 – 5 September 1997), better known as
                Mother Teresa (Albanian: Nënë Tereza), was an Albanian-Indian Catholic nun who, in 1950, founded the
                Missionaries of Charity. Anjezë Gonxhe Bojaxhiu (pronounced [aˈɲɛzə ˈɡɔndʒɛ bɔjaˈdʒiu]) was born in
                Skopje—at the time, part of the Ottoman Empire.[a] After eighteen years, she moved to Ireland and then
                to India, where she lived most of her life. Saint Teresa of Calcutta[b] was canonised on 4 September
                2016. The anniversary of her death is her feast day.</p>


            <h2>Missionaries of Charity</h2>
            <p>On 10 September 1946, Teresa experienced what she later described as "the call within the call" when she
                travelled by train to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling from Calcutta for her annual retreat. "I was to
                leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. To fail would have been to
                break the faith."[35] Joseph Langford later wrote, "Though no one knew it at the time, Sister Teresa had
                just become Mother Teresa"</p>
            <p>She began missionary work with the poor in 1948,[24] replacing her traditional Loreto habit with a
                simple, white cotton sari with a blue border. Mother Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent several
                months in Patna to receive basic medical training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the
                slums.[37][38] She founded a school in Motijhil, Calcutta, before she began tending to the poor and
                hungry.[39] At the beginning of 1949, Mother Teresa was joined in her effort by a group of young women,
                and she laid the foundation for a new religious community helping the "poorest among the poor"</p>
            <p>The Missionaries of Charity Brothers was founded in 1963, and a contemplative branch of the Sisters
                followed in 1976. Lay Catholics and non-Catholics were enrolled in the Co-Workers of Mother Teresa, the
                Sick and Suffering Co-Workers, and the Lay Missionaries of Charity. Responding to requests by many
                priests, in 1981, Mother Teresa founded the Corpus Christi Movement for Priests[52] and with Joseph
                Langford founded the Missionaries of Charity Fathers in 1984 to combine the vocational aims of the
                Missionaries of Charity with the resources of the priesthood.[53]

                By 1997, the 13-member Calcutta congregation had grown to more than 4,000 sisters who managed
                orphanages, AIDS hospices and charity centers worldwide, caring for refugees, the blind, disabled, aged,
                alcoholics, the poor and homeless and victims of floods, epidemics and famine.[54] By 2007, the
                Missionaries of Charity numbered about 450 brothers and 5,000 sisters worldwide, operating 600 missions,
                schools and shelters in 120 countries.[55]
